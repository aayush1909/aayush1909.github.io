I am a Master's Student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) majoring in Data Science. Currently, I am working at [TerraClear Inc.](https://www.terraclear.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern. I have a Bachelor in Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai - [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/en), India. Owing to my prior coursework, academic projects and industry experiences, I now have over 3 years of experience in Software Development, Machine Learning and Analytics. I bring to the table a blend of technical, aptitude and problem-solving skills.
