"Aayush was my TA this quarter for a machine learning course at the University of Washington. He was extremely helpful, took initiative, and was able to work very independently. He clearly has a large set of technical skills and know-how in data science/machine learning. I am happy to recommend him."

"I am so grateful for Aayush's help as my TA this quarter. Not only was he always a step ahead on his work, but he also went out of his way to see what else he could do to help. His knowledge of python was impressive, he was very self-reliant and he even provided the students with great feedback and guidance. I would recommend him in heartbeat."
